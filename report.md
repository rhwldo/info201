In the mid-1980s, women constituted 37% of those awarded bachelor‚Äôs degrees in computer science in the U.S., marking a peak before a steady decline ensued, contrasting the advancements toward gender parity seen in other scientific and technical fields. This trend underscores the growing male dominance within computer science, diverging from broader educational progress. The report, illustrated by Catherine D‚ÄôIgnazio and based on data from the National Center for Education Statistics, considers gender in binary terms, thus excluding nonbinary individuals from its analysis. This visualization highlights a concerning gender imbalance in the field, sparking discussions on inclusivity and diversity.

> "According to a research report published by the American Association of University Women in 2015, women computer science graduates in the United States peaked in the mid-1980s at 37 percent, and we have seen a steady decline in the years since then to 26 percent today (figure 1.2).25 As ‚Äúdata analysts‚Äù (low-status number crunchers) have become rebranded as ‚Äúdata scientists‚Äù (high status researchers), women are being pushed out in order to make room for more highly valued and more highly compensated men."

## Data Viz Biography

1. **Who or what institution produced the visualization?**

   Graphic by Catherine D‚ÄôIgnazio. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics.

2. **When was it produced?**

   1970s-2010

3. **Who is the audience for the visualization?**

   The audience for this visualization, titled "Computer Science, the Man Factory," likely comprises educators, policymakers, academic researchers, students, and gender equity advocates. The aim is to inform and influence those involved in computer science education and gender studies by showing historical trends in the gender distribution of computer science degrees. The impactful message it conveys would resonate with anyone interested in fostering diversity and inclusion within STEM fields.

4. **How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**

   The visualization could be interpreted as a clear depiction of gender disparity in computer science over time, underscoring a significant issue in the field's academic community. It highlights the peak of women's participation in the mid-1980s and the subsequent decline, suggesting a need for interventions to promote gender equality. However, it might be misinterpreted in a few ways. Some viewers might oversimplify the decline of women's participation as a result of lack of interest or ability in computer science, which ignores systemic issues such as cultural biases, lack of role models, or unwelcoming environments in tech-related fields. Others might conclude that the situation is irreversible or that efforts to correct the imbalance are ineffective, leading to a sense of defeatism or apathy.

   If policymakers or educators misunderstand the graph, they may not implement necessary measures to support women in computer science, such as mentorship programs, scholarships, or inclusive curricula. Additionally, if the data leads to stereotyping, it could perpetuate a self-fulfilling prophecy where young women may self-select out of computer science pathways due to a perceived lack of belonging.

5. **How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**

   The data visualization represents power dynamics within the educational and professional systems of computer science. By showcasing the distribution of degrees between genders, it implicitly highlights the systemic barriers that women face in entering and remaining in the field, suggesting male dominance not just in numbers but in the underlying power structures. The graph hints at a system that historically privileges men, potentially through biased recruitment practices, gendered socialization that influences academic choices, or workplace cultures that discourage female participation. It reflects the systemic nature of gender inequality in STEM and invites scrutiny into how educational policies, cultural norms, and institutional practices maintain this imbalance.
